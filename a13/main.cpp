 Assignment 13
 
 Create fantasy role-playing game with four different types of Creatures: Humans,
 Cyberdemons, Balrogs and elves.
 
 The getDamage() function outputs and returns the damage this Creature can inflict in one
 round of combat. The rules for determining the damage are as follows:
    - Every Creature inflicts damage that is a random number r, where 0 < r <= strength.
    - Demons have a 25% chance of inflicting a demonic attack which is an additional 50
      damage points. Balrogs and Cyberdemons are Demons.
    - With a 50% chance elves inflict a magical attack that doubles the normal amount of
      damage.
    - Balrogs are very fast, so they get to attack twice

/*
 Definition of battleArena. Function passes in two Creature objects (creature1 and
 creature2). It displays the initial hitpoints of each Creature. It calls getDamage()
 function for each creature and updates the hitpoints for each via setHitpoints() function.
 It continues until either or both creatures has less than 0 hitpoints and displays the
 winner or tie.
