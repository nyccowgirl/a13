 Assignment 13
 
 Create fantasy role-playing game with four different types of Creatures: Humans,
 Cyberdemons, Balrogs and elves.
 
 The getDamage() function outputs and returns the damage this Creature can inflict in one
 round of combat. The rules for determining the damage are as follows:
    - Every Creature inflicts damage that is a random number r, where 0 < r <= strength.
    - Demons have a 25% chance of inflicting a demonic attack which is an additional 50
      damage points. Balrogs and Cyberdemons are Demons.
    - With a 50% chance elves inflict a magical attack that doubles the normal amount of
      damage.
    - Balrogs are very fast, so they get to attack twice
